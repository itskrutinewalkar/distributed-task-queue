# Distributed Task Queue

A job queue system built in Go that spawns workers, handles retries, and tracks job status. Built with Redis for queueing and PostgreSQL for persistent job storage.

# Neccessity

Big companies like Uber, Netflix, and Amazon don’t just handle one task at a time.

They handle:
-millions of users
-millions of requests
-thousands of background operations

Example: **Uber**

When you book a ride, following steps should be executed:

-Match driver
-Calculate price
-Notify driver
-Track ride
-Send receipt

-**Some tasks must be instant**
-**Others can happen in background**

Example:

Sending email receipt → can be delayed
Fraud detection → runs in background

Without a queue: App becomes slow or crashes

👉 The problem is:

You cannot do everything instantly, in one place, at the same time.

My distributed task queue:

✔ Stores tasks safely
✔ Processes them in background
✔ Retries failed ones
✔ Tracks status
✔ Scales with demand

## Note
*This project is built simply out of interest and to understand how these systems work under the hood.*

## Tech Stack

- **Go** — core application
- **Redis** — job queue (LPUSH/BRPOP)
- **PostgreSQL** — persistent job storage and status tracking
- **Docker** — running Redis and PostgreSQL locally

## Project Structure

```

## How It Works

```
POST /jobs
    ↓
Enqueue()
    ├── Save full job to PostgreSQL  (status = pending)
    └── Push job ID to Redis list    (LPUSH queue:default)

Worker (running in background)
    ├── BRPOP queue:default          (blocks until job arrives)
    ├── Fetch full job from Postgres
    ├── Mark as running
    ├── Process job
    └── Mark as completed / failed
            └── If failed + attempts < max_retries → re-enqueue (RPUSH)
```

## Job Lifecycle

```
pending → running → completed
                 ↘ failed (if attempts >= max_retries)
                 ↘ pending (re-enqueued for retry)
```

## Prerequisites

- Go 1.21+
- Docker Desktop

## Setup

**1. Clone the repo**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/krutinewalkar/distributed-task-queue
cd distributed-task-queue
```

**2. Start PostgreSQL and Redis with Docker**

```bash
docker run --name postgres \
  -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=password \
  -e POSTGRES_USER=taskqueue \
  -e POSTGRES_DB=taskqueue \
  -p 5432:5432 \
  -d postgres:latest

docker run --name redis \
  -p 6379:6379 \
  -d redis:latest
```

**3. Run the database migration**

```bash
docker exec -i postgres psql -U taskqueue -d taskqueue < migrations/001_create_jobs.sql
```

**4. Install dependencies**

```bash
go mod tidy
```

**5. Run**

```bash
go run main.go
```

You should see:

```
Postgres connected
Redis connected
Worker started for queue: default
```

## Job Schema

| Column      | Type         | Description                          |
|-------------|--------------|--------------------------------------|
| id          | VARCHAR(36)  | UUID, primary key                    |
| queue       | VARCHAR(100) | Queue name, default = "default"      |
| payload     | TEXT         | JSON string with job data            |
| status      | VARCHAR(20)  | pending / running / completed / failed |
| attempts    | INTEGER      | How many times the job has been tried |
| max_retries | INTEGER      | Max attempts before marking failed   |
| error       | TEXT         | Error message if job failed          |
| created_at  | TIMESTAMP    | When the job was created             |
| updated_at  | TIMESTAMP    | Last status update                   |

## Retry Logic

- Every job gets `max_retries = 3` by default
- On failure, `attempts` is incremented
- If `attempts < max_retries`, job is re-enqueued with `RPUSH` (goes to back of queue)
- If `attempts >= max_retries`, job is marked `failed` permanently

## Verifying Jobs

**Check all jobs in Postgres:**

```bash
docker exec -it postgres psql -U taskqueue -d taskqueue -c "SELECT id, status, attempts FROM jobs;"
```

**Check Redis queue:**

```bash
docker exec -it redis redis-cli LRANGE queue:default 0 -1
```
